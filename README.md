# OnlineQuizApp

This is a small online "quiz" type game. Players have multiple categories to choose from and, of course, the application supports user login feature and a leadeboard to raise competitiveness and fun among its community. 

Behind the scenes:
    -the login/register feature and the in-game data all was implemented using Google Firebase Database due its ability to monitorize the performance among all the users which helps me to know what and how I have to improve the game in order to be delightful for its players 
    -The UI is backed by a RecycleView which should provide the game with a more a efficent dynamic Views compered to the old ListView which creates a new View for every item and that may lag on low performance devices.
